## Duplicator

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Duplicator makes it seamlessly for content editors to duplicate entries, terms, assets & forms from inside the Statamic Control Panel.

If you want to learn how Duplicator works under the hood, I've written [a blog post just for you](https://duncanmcclean.com/under-the-hood-of-the-duplicator-addon?ref=duplicator-readme).

> Hopefully soon, Duplicator will be part of Statamic Core - meaning you won't need this addon anymore. Feel free to go and [give the PR a big 👍](https://github.com/statamic/cms/pull/6307)

## Installation

First, require Duplicator as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/duplicator
```

Optionally, you may publish Duplicator's configuration file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="duplicator-config"
```

Now you can start duplicating!

## Documentation

Review the documentation on the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/duncanmcclean/duplicator/docs).

## Support

Duplicator is a free addon, because of this there is no direct support channel. If you have a feature request or experience a bug, please [open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/duncanmcclean/duplicator/issues/new/choose) and it'll be looked into over the next week or two.

> Only the latest version of this addon is supported. If you open a bug report using an old version, your issue will be closed.

## Sponsor me!

Some of my addons (including this one) are free & open-source, meaning you can use them in your site without buying any licenses.

However, there is a cost from my perspective to maintain this addon (fixing new bugs, adding new features, answering questions). That all takes time. I've spent over **10 hours** of my own time maintaining this addon over the past year.

If you use this software on your projects & can afford it, I'd appreciate it if you'd consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean), even if it's just a couple dollars a month.
